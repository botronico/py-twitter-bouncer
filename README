This project uses python-twitter from google code to recieve Direct
Messages on twitter and repeat them as updates.  This could be used
for an anonymous multi-user bouncer with some code tweaks, but its
original intent is as an easy, cheap way to do mass SMS.

See the anonymous branch for the anonymous version.

Bouncer un/pw go in secret.py.  That file is straightforward.
I may replace it with YAML or something but I don't see the value
in doing so.

Right now twitbounce.py does all the work.  The other scripts
used to do something useful until API changes kind of broke
python-twitter.  I'll probably get rid of the python-twitter
dependancy at some point, but that'll take a bit of work.
