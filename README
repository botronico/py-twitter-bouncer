This project uses python-twitter from google code to recieve Direct
Messages on twitter and repeat them as updates.  This could be used
for an anonymous multi-user bouncer with some code tweaks, but its
original intent is as an easy, cheap way to do mass SMS.

See the anonymous branch for the anonymous version.
