This project uses python-twitter from google code to recieve Direct
Messages on twitter and repeat them as updates.  This could be used
for an anonymous multi-user bouncer with some code tweaks, but its
original intent is as an easy, cheap way to do mass SMS.

twitbounce.py has an option to be anonymous now

All configuration is in twitter.cfg - the file is straightforward

Right now twitbounce.py does all the work.  The other scripts show
who's following, who your friends (people you follow, and therefore
can DM you) are, and allow you to add and remove friends.  The API
doesn't support follow requests so if you make your updates private
you have to do that manually.
